        10.8
    </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>windows and macOS binaries are now code-signed, which increases security and should reduce warnings on installation</li>
            <li>now can undo/redo when manually adjusting the teams using drag-and-drop</li>
            <li>behind-the-scenes code reorganization for future integration with Canvas and more direct Google integration</li>
        </ul>

        10.7.1
    </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>increased max number of students to 500; works fast enough with 500 students, though it does get pretty slow when class size is very large and Required Teammates or Non-Teammates are used</li>
            <li>adjusted scoring when team has more-than-desired schedule overlap to prevent runaway scores with high overlap</li>
            <li>when a student has misspelled another student's name that they've given in their survey response as a preferred teammate or non-teammate, the select-matching-name-dialogue now includes the requesting student's name</li>
            <li>improved the graph of optimization progress--now colors plot blue/pink when there is/is not at least one genome that meets all the rules</li>
            <li>improved UI in start window, with message confirming user has the latest version and is registered</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2 class="text-center p-3">
        10.7
    </h2>

        <ul>

            <li>significantly expanded the algorithm that recognizes timezone data in the survey</li>
            <li>Bugfix - now correctly displays at full width the UI elements in the teamset tabs</li>
            <li>updated C++ code standard to C++17, removing several deprecated QT elements in the process</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="text-center p-3">
        10.6.1

            <li>Bugfix - fixed crash on mac when changing the matched name in the select-matching-name dialog</li>
            <li>Bugfix - now correctly handles sub-version numbers when checking for new versions on startup</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="text-center p-3">
        10.6
    </h2>

        <li>the count of how many students gave each response now updates in the attributeTabs when changing the section being placed on teams</li>
        <li>an indicator of the maximum value of schedule and attribute weights has been added</li>
        <li>Bugfix - attribute tabs in gruepr now show at proper width</li>

        10.5

            <ul>
                <li>in gruepr, the attribute tabs now show a count of how many students gave each of the responses</li>
                <li>in gruepr, when the attribute is home timezone, the offset from GMT is shown instead of a letter as the response value</li>
                <li>in surveymaker, tabs can now be moved or closed in order to quickly rearrange or remove attribute questions in the survey</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Bugfix - adding a new student now correctly sets their schedule as ambiguous</li>

        <ul>
            <li>multiple team sets can be viewed simultaneously on different tabs. This can be used to compare easily the teams you get using different teaming options, or perhaps you'd like to create the teams for a few different sections and keep them all open before saving / printing them.</li>
            <li>now can load Prevented Teammates directly from an open Teams Tab. This can be used so that multiple team sets can be created with the same students and same teaming options, but where everyone gets all new teammates in each team set.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bugfix - team scores were miscalculated in certain rare cases</li>
        <li>the "actions" in the required / prevented / requested teammates dialog now only get applied to the students listed in the table (i.e., the students in the section being considered) as suggested by the wording</li>
        <li>as always, internal code cleanup and modernization--optimization might be slightly faster</li>
